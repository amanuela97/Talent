- Remove the general_category and specific_category from the Talent model and implement a more dynamic approach by following all the instructions below.

Step 1: Database Modeling
Create a Categories Table/Collection:

Fields:

id (unique identifier)

name – the category name (e.g., "Musician", "Folk Band")

type – a string enum such as "general" or "specific".

parentId – for a specific category, link it to its general category’s id (for general categories, this can be null).

status – to manage the category lifecycle (active, pending, rejected).

Timestamps: store fields for created_at and updated_at.

Relationship with Talent Data Model:

Modify Talent model to reference one or more categories.

Depending on your needs, a many-to-many join table (e.g., talent_categories) may be appropriate if talents can have multiple category tags.

Step 2: Backend (NestJS) Implementation
Create Category Module:

Category Entity/Model: Define the entity with the fields mentioned above.

Category DTOs: Create Data Transfer Objects for:

Returning category data (for suggestions).

Accepting new category suggestions.

Updating status (approve/reject).

API Endpoints:

GET /talent_categories:

Supports query parameters:

type: "general" or "specific".

search: a search term to filter categories using fuzzy matching.

Implementation: Use a repository method (or query builder) to perform a case-insensitive search against the name field.

POST /talent_categories:

Accepts a payload for a new category suggestion (includes name, type, and optionally parentId for specifics).

Set its initial status to "pending".

Validation: Ensure similar existing categories aren’t duplicated (use fuzzy-matching if needed).

PUT /talent_categories/:id/approve:

Accessible only to admins.

Change category status from pending to active or rejected.

Optionally allow admin edits (e.g., correcting typos or merging with an existing category).

Step 3: Frontend (Next.js) Implementation
Create Auto-Suggest Components:

Using a UI Library:

Integrate a typeahead or autocomplete component.

One component for the general_category input and another for the specific_category input, where the available specifics are filtered by the selected general category.

Dynamic API Calls:

As the user types in the category field, implement a debounce function (e.g., 300–500ms) to send requests to GET /categories with the search parameter.

Display auto-suggested results in a dropdown.

If no suggestions exist, display an option such as “Add new: [UserInput].”

Submitting New Category Suggestions:

When the user clicks “Add new: [UserInput]”, make a POST /categories API call with the new category details and set the status to pending.

Notify the user that the category has been submitted for review.

Handling Specific Categories:

Once a general category is selected or confirmed, filter the suggestions for the specific categories based on the parentId linked to the chosen general category.

Allow similar “add new” actions for specific categories if no matching entry is found.

Make sure to update the GeneralCategoryStep.tsx and SpecificCategoryStep.tsx to use this dynamice approach instead of the hard coded values.

Step 4: Moderation UI for Category Management
Administrator Dashboard:

Build a category-approval admin page under /admin/dashboard that lists all category suggestions with a status of pending.

Display details such as the name, type, and parentId if applicable.

Admin Actions:

For each pending category, provide actionable buttons:

Approve: Calls the PUT /categories/:id/status endpoint.

Reject: Calls the PUT /categories/:id/status endpoint.

Also allow inline editing of the category name if needed before approval.
